# Wolfenstein 3D Modded
 Heavily modded vanilla Wolfenstein 3D

This version of Wolfenstein 3D has improvements over the original vanilla game. It includes the following:

* Overhead Map that uses tile16 graphics and includes all objects in the game
* God Mode, No Clipping and Overhead Map don't require debug keys and can be called using only [TAB]-G, [TAB]-N and [TAB]-O
* God Mode uses the images of BJ from Spear of Destiny
* BJ Panting in the intermission screen corrected with the appropriate sprite taken from v1.1

This version requires a heavily modified VGAGRAPH.WL6 file, not included in this repository. Refer to the modding pages at https://wayneca.neocities.org/Wolfenstein/modding.html for information on what changes to make to the VGAGRAPH.WL6 file and how to make them.

DO NOT TRY TO USE THE STOCK VGAGRAPH.WL6 FILE WITH THESE MODS! THE GAME WILL CRASH IF YOU DO!
